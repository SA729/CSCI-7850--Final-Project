Mathematical models are an becoming increasingly powerful tool in
cancer biology to understand the complex interactions between 
the immune system and the tumor. Numerical approximation methods are commonly 
used to solve and simulate the tumor-immune dynamics. These methods rely on the discretization and hence, solutions are discrete or have limited differentiability. Growing evidence suggests that neural networks provide more accurate and precise information about tumor-immune dynamics. In this work, we use a neural network to solve and simulate the nonlinear ordinary differential equation based tumor immune model and we compare the results with numerical solutions based on Runge-Kutta 4 th order method.
